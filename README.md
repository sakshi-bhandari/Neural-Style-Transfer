#VGG19: Neural Style Transfer

VGG 19 Implementation for generating artistic images using neural style transfer (Gatys et al.). It merges two images, namely: a "content" image (C) and a "style" image (S), to create a "generated" image (G). We use Transfer Learning from the original 19 layer VGG network which was already trained on a very large set of images.

I have generated an image of the Louvre museum in Paris (content image C), mixed with a painting by Claude Monet, a leader of the impressionist movement (style image S). User can change it according to their own requirement.
